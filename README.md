# Autonomous Driving

The aim of this project was to find the best algorithm to control an autonomous car in a virtual environement using lidar-like sensors.  The car should be capable of driving on multiple tracks without hitting the walls or driving in the wrong direction and must complete the tracks under the minimum time possible.

## The virtual environment

V-REP - the Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform - is a 3D robot simulation software, with integrated development environment, that allows you to model, edit, program and simulate any robot or robotic system (e.g. sensors, mechanisms, etc.).
